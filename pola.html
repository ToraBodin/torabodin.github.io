            Pola is an interactive photo frame inspired by vintage polariod photos, the inaccessibility of modern
            online-photo storage and the slow design philosophy. It works by displaying a photograph from an online
            collection on its screen for a couple of days before fading the photo to black. When the owner notices the
            faded-out frame, they have to shake the frame to make a new photograph appear. By this interaction, a short
            moment of conscious interaction with the technology is created, before ultimately making it fade into the
            background again.

            This project began as a group project at Chalmers University of Technology. I am currently continuing the
            project with the aim of creating a viable research product fit for a cultural probe-study.

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The initial challenge for Pola was to design an artefact that would repeatedly break down and be in need of
            repair by its owner. We quickly decided to work with a more reflective design approach, and explore ways to
            work with slow technology in the home environment.

          <h2>Ideation and explorative research</h2>
          <p>
            By conducting interviews and home-visits, we learned that people most often choose to repair things for two
            different reasons: Because the thing that broke is expensive, or because it has a nostalgic value. Nostalgic
            and sentimental objects are often things like notebooks, gifts or photographs.

          <blockquote>
            "We have probably stopped noticing the pictures. I usually just pick them up when they fall down. When
            people
            are visiting, they go straight for them.
            I actively look at the pictures when putting them back up."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The home-visits introduced us to an interesting scenario: Two participants described how they would often
            forget that they had pictures on their walls, as these tended to fade into the background over time.
            Occasionally, their photographs would fall down from the wall. When this happened, the participants would
            often take a moment to truly look at the photo while putting it back up.
          </p>

          <p>
            This lead us to a general concept in which a tangible photo-frame would indicate that it had been forgotten
            over time. After being forgotten, it should allow for a reflective moment while the user took time to
            interact with the object, thereby remembering it.

          <p>
            Further fine-tuning of the concept lead us to adapt the symbolic representation of old photographs in
            several aspects. When being "forgotten", the photo-fram will fade away to nothing. To be remembered, the
            photo requires a shake, similar to shaking a polaroid to make it fade into view.

          <h2>Prototyping</h2>
          <p>
            An initial technical test was conducted with an arduino mini, a led light and an IMU sensor, to explore
            the
            possibilities of the interaction.

          The final prototype was constructed with a Raspberry Pi 4, a hyperpixel screen-hat and an IMU sensor. The
          entire prototype was built in Pyhton.

        Further inquires were made into defining the shape of the frame. Several simple foamcore prototypes of the
        case
        were constructed, and the importance of shape and wirelessness was explored.

      <p>
        For the next iteration of this prototype, my goal is to construct a viable research product that can be
        reproduced and later conduct a cultural probe-study.
      </p>
      <p>Some things on my to-do-list are:
      <ul>
        <li>Do performance tests for long-term usage</li>
        <li>Set up a data log system</li>
        <li>Set up reliable internet access</li>
        <li>Design and 3D-print sturdy casing</li>
      </ul>
